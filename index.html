                            <p> C++ is a general purpose programming
                                language and widely used now a days '
                                for competitive programming. It has
                                imperative, object-oriented and generic
                                programming features. C++ runs on lots of
                                platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                                C++ is an efficient
                                and powerful language and finds wide use
                                in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and
                                real-time simulations. Because of the
                                inclusion of rich function libraries,
                                working in C++ becomes simpler and
                                convenient than C. Being object-oriented
                                programming like Java, C++ provides
                                the support of inheritance, polymorphism,
                                encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows
                                exception handling and function overloading.</p>
                                <p>he “Hello World” program is the first
                                    step towards learning any programming
                                    language and also one of the simplest
                                    programs you will learn. All you have
                                    to do is display the message “Hello World”
                                    on the screen.</p>

                            <p>  Object-oriented programming – As the name
                                suggests uses objects in programming.
                                Object-oriented programming aims to
                                implement real-world entities like
                                inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                                etc in programming. The main
                                aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                                and the functions that operate on them
                                so that no other part of the code can
                                access this data except that function.</p>
